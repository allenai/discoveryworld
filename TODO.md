# Rosetta Stone

The goal of this rosetta stone is to discover the meaning of some alien words.
With that new knowledge, the agent should be able to complete a task given by the elder in the alien language.

# Tasks:
#   put  [X] in/on [Y],
#   open [X] with [Y],
#   give [X] to [y]
#   take [X] of [Y]
# Store selling keys
# Store selling color paint


  # We get an instruction in an alien language
  # e.g. You need the blue key to unlock the door.
  # e.g. Open/close chest/door
  # e.g. lock/unlock chest/door with color key
  # e.g. give water/object to someone
  # e.g. understand numbers from hearing clock (requires time system)
  # e.g. understand numbers from looking at a rock/mushromom/cats/ collection.
  # e.g. understand numbers from using a dispenser machine: you press the button and get that many items.
  # Open/close is learned from flipping a lever and hearing a click, need to go and see the outcome.

## How to learn numbers
We have a flag pole, a counting computer, and several programs on different floppy disks.
When the agent use the computer with a floppy disk, the flagpole will raise a flag according to the value contained within the program.
The flagpole cannot be raised higher than a predetermined height (5 at the momen).
We have a special program that resets the flagpole to 0.
The floppy disks label represent the number they contain.

## How to learn people's names
We have multiple house with a doorbell. We can press the doorbell to hear the name of the person living in that house.
Maybe we could have a house with twins.

## How to learn object names
We have many different shops that display different projects with a sign next to it with their name.
We could have a single supertmarket to display all the products.


## How to learn the "give" and "take/receive" concept
In the shops/supermarket/mall we could have a sign with emojis showing:
  - Give: [money] -> [vendor]
  - Receive: [product] -> [you]



# Random thoughts
 - Agent should start with some money to limit brute force.
